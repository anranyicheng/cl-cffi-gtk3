cl-cffi-gtk3 is a Lisp binding to GTK 3 (GIMP Toolkit) which is a library
for creating graphical user interfaces. cl-cffi-gtk3 is licensed using the LGPL
which has been adopted with a preamble that clarifies the terms for use with
Lisp programs and is referred as the LLGPL.

This work is based on the cl-gtk2 library which has been developed by
Kalyanov Dmitry and already is a fairly complete Lisp binding to GTK.

The cl-cffi-gtk3 library was part of the cl-cffi-gtk library and was
separated out to be used independently. The former cl-cffi-gtk library is
replaced with the cl-cffi-gtk3 for GTK 3 and the cl-cffi-gtk4 library for GTK 4.

The focus of this work is to document the library more complete and to
do the implementation as consistent as possible. Most informations about GTK+
can be gained by reading the C documentation. Therefore, a modified version of
the C documentation from http://www.gtk.org is included into the Lisp files to
document the Lisp binding to the GTK library. The API documentation is
available online at http://www.crategus.com/books/cl-cffi-gtk3/

Examples of the usage are included in a gtk3-demo and gtk3-example.
