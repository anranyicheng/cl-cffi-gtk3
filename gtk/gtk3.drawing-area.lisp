  @begin{short}
    The @sym{gtk:drawing-area} widget is used for creating custom user
    interface elements. It is essentially a blank widget. You can draw on it.
  @end{short}
  After creating a drawing area, the application may want to connect to:
  @begin{itemize}
    @begin{item}
      Mouse and button press signals to respond to input from the user. Use the
      @fun{gtk:widget-add-events} function to enable events you wish to receive.
    @end{item}
    @begin{item}
      The \"realize\" signal to take any necessary actions when the widget is
      instantiated on a particular display. Create GDK resources in response
      to this signal.
    @end{item}
    @begin{item}
      The \"configure-event\" signal to take any necessary actions when the
      widget changes size.
    @end{item}
    @begin{item}
      The \"draw\" signal to handle redrawing the contents of the widget.
    @end{item}
  @end{itemize}
  Draw signals are normally delivered when a drawing area first comes onscreen,
  or when it is covered by another window and then uncovered. You can also force
  an expose event by adding to the \"damage region\" of the drawing area's
  window. The @fun{gtk:widget-queue-draw-area} and
  @fun{gdk:window-invalidate-rect} functions are equally good ways to do this.
  You will then get a draw signal for the invalid region.

  To receive mouse events on a drawing area, you will need to enable them with
  the @fun{gtk:widget-add-events} function. To receive keyboard events, you
  will need to set the @slot[gtk:widget]{can-focus} property on the drawing
  area, and you should probably draw some user visible indication that the
  drawing area is focused. Use the @fun{gtk:widget-has-focus} function in your
  expose event handler to decide whether to draw the focus indicator. See the
  @see-function{gtk:render-focus} function for one way to draw focus.
  @begin[Example]{dictionary}
    The following example demonstrates using a drawing area to display a
    circle in the normal widget foreground color.

    Note that GDK automatically clears the exposed area before sending the
    expose event, and that drawing is implicitly clipped to the exposed area.
    If you want to have a theme-provided background, you need to call the
    @fun{gtk:render-background} function in your \"draw\" signal handler.
